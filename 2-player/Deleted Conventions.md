### Tempo Clue Chop Move Change (Jeff)

* Consider the following game-state:
  * Red and green 1 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a red 2. She knows rank, but not color.
  * Bob has a non-critical, unclued red 3 on chop.
  * There are no 3s in the discard.
* In this situation, Alice is unable to save Bob’s red 3. For this reason, we turn off *[Tempo Clue Chop Moves](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-tempo-clue-chop-move)* in 2-player. If Bob gives a *Tempo Clue* to Alice, she’ll be able to safely give a *Play Clue* to Bob’s red 3 and save it from being discarded.
* *Tempo clues* are therefore encouraged in 2-player, as they allow the team to save non-critical connecting cards.
* However, it would be wasteful to give a *Tempo Clue* which does not allow the team to save a non-critical connecting card. In this scenario, this would be a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.
* For example, in a *[6 Suit](https://hanabi.live/replay/177641/42)* game:
  * The game-state are shown as the following screenshot. 
  * Kimbifille has a g3 (touched by a 3 clue) on slot 2, a g2 (touched by a green clue) on slot 4, and a b5 on slot 5.
  * Charmander gives a 2 clue touching the g2 as a *Tempo Clue*.
  * Kimbifille knows that *Tempo Clues* are encouraged in 2-player, but she would have saved g3, g4 and g5 anyway, since they're all critical. So this *Tempo Clue* offers no value to the team. It must be a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*.

* Note that this convention is turned off when pace is low or when the player in a special *Stalling* situation.
* This convention was deleted because even if Jeff draws g4.  Kimbi can't play as she doesn't know where g2 is.  Jeff MUST tempo.
